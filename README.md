# Book finder - Desktop application

In this school project I combined three JavaScript assignments into one; API Consumption, Functional programming and Modules, Package Managers and Bundlers. I created a book finder application and used the Google books API.
You can search by title, author, keyword etc. You can clear the results and choose to sort them by relevance or newest. Every result has a link to Google preview of that book.

I created a backend server using npm package manager, express framework and some modules. That's in another repo and was deployed separately with Vercel. This repo contains the client side/frontend. I used functional programming in both. You can find comments in the JavaScript code for further explaination.

Here is a link to the backend server repo: <https://github.com/bjorgg/JavaScript-Backend-server.git>

Here is a link to the live version: <https://bjorgg.github.io/Book-finder/>
